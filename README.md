Library mangement using C
# ABSTRACT 
With the advancement of technology, it is imperative to exalt all the systems into a  user-friendly manner. The Library Management system (LMS) acts as a tool to  transform traditional libraries into digital libraries.In traditional libraries, the students/user has to search for books which  are hassle process and there is no proper maintenance of database about  issues/fines. The overall progress of work is slow and it is impossible to generate  a fast report. The librarians have to work allotted for arranging, sorting books in  the book sells. At the same time, they have to check and monitor the lend/borrow  book details with its fine. It is a tedious process to work simultaneously in  different sectors.LMS will assist the librarians to work easily. The LMS supports the  librarians to encounter all the issues concurrently. The users need not stand in a  queue for a long period to return/borrow a book from the library. The single PC  contains all the data’s in it. The librarians have to assess the system and provide  an entry in it. Through LMS the librarian can find the book in the  bookshelves. The LMS is designed with the basic features such as librarian  can add/view/update/delete books and students' details in it. Once he/she ingress  into the system they can modify any data’s in the database. The complete model is  developed in C language.The transactions like login, register, add , search, delete, issue are  provided. The Library Management System stores the details like name,  address, ID number , Date Of Birth of members working in the library and  users who come to library. The details of books like book name, book number,  subject to which it belongs , author, edition, year of publication , the total number of books that are present in the library etc are also stored.
# OVERVIEW
A library is a place where a huge collection of books and resources  are available which can be accessible by the users. It acts as a brain for the  institutions. It enhances the dissemination of knowledge and spiritual  civilization among the students. The tons of books and research works are  captivating the students to improvise their knowledge in all perspectives.  It guides the students to promote their views differently.This knowledge optimizes the student to achieve a better result in  academic as well as personal skill development. Improvisation in technology  causes the demand for developing a way to enhance the traditional library set up  to digital one. Numerous tedious processes reduce the efficiency of the library.  For example, it always needs manual support to do any activities in the  traditional library. The count and details of books are scribbled in the paper for  reference. Each data is fetched in the notebook for future citations.To examine any data then they have to refer the notebooks. At the  same time while distributing the books to the students they have to enter into the  notebook where they need to represent the book id, distribution and renewal  date, and student id. The librarians/staff have to assign a tag for each book and  provide an id for it. They have to align and arrange the books on the shelves and  marked it. Missing or theft of the book builds a serious issue and confusion to  the librarians.While collecting the book from the students they have to verify  the penalties of the books. Therefore it causes a monotonous among the  staff. Consequently, it builds an uninteresting among the student due to the slow  progress of the staff. To evoke the library into the technological era, we  presented a system called Library management system. 
# AIM & OBJECTIVES 
The aim of this project is to develop a system that can be handle  and manage the activities involved in an efficient and reliable way. 
The objectives are  
 i.Designing a computerized library management system which help  evacuate the problem faced in manual library. 
 ii.Implementing the system. 
 iii.Evaluating and testing the performance of the system.
# BACK GROUND OF THE STUDY
A library is comprised of the following sections, based on the services rendered. 
i.Acquisition Section: The books demanded by different departments are done by the Acquisition section. University book centre is also  
working in this section for supply of books to the libraries in  this university. 
ii.Technical Section: To classify, catalogue, OPAC ,Barcode etc. the  documents of the University Library this section is working. 
iii.Circulation Section:This section provides documents to the members and  users of library for home reading as well as reading in the  
library. The documents are arranged on the racks in stacks as  per the Dewey Decimal Classification Scheme. 
iv.PeriodicalSection:To procure, maintain and arrange periodicals services to library members. Periodical section provides reference service  with respect to the requirement of the reader. Reference section  is attached to periodical section for convenience of the Library  users. 
v.Databases: Databases like OPAC, CAB-CD ROM abstracting databases,  DELNET online Network Service etc. are available for the  
library members. 
vi.Reprographic Section: This Section has two automatic plain paper copiers  and a duplicating machine through which the services of  
photocopy are provided to the readers 
vii.Binding Section: This section is working for binding work of the damaged  books. Back Volumes and other documents of this Library. The  required binding machinery is available in this section. 
 Library management is a sub-discipline of institutional management that focuses on specific issues faced by libraries and library management  professionals.  
 Library management encompasses normal management tasks as well  as intellectual freedom, anti-censorship, and fund raising tasks. Issues faced in  library management frequently overlap those faced in management of non-profit  organizations(Sharma et al.,2005). 
 Library Management System is an application that portraits library  system which could be generally small or medium in size. It is used by the  librarian to categorically manage the library by the virtue of using a computerized system where he/she can record various transactions like issue of  books, return of books, addition of new books, addition of new students etc.  
# DEVELOPMENT OF LMS
A library management system is a system for a library resource  planning, used to access the documents held, orders, payment  or lending all made by the clients. Sometime, a phrase like  
library integrated system is employed, especially in the UK.  
Cynthia Lopta defines the integrated system as an automated  system in which all the functional modules share the same  
bibliographic database. Integration as a concept is most usually  found in biblioteconomy. It became a landmark over20 years  ago, and it has grown into an almost synonym for integrated  
system. Sometimes, integrated refers to a system in which the  library functions are processed in a main bibliographic file.  
By the mid to late 2000s, library management system vendors  not only the number of services offered but also their prices  
leading to some dissatisfaction among many smaller libraries.  At the same time open source Integrated Library System was in  its early stages of testing. Some libraries began to such open  
source integrated library system as KOHA and Evergreen.  
Most reasons noted from these were to avoid vendor lock in,  license fees and participate in software development. The much  
needed freedom from vendors also allowed libraries to  prioritize need according to urgency, as opposed to what their  vendor can offer.  
Recently, libraries which have moved to open source integrated  library system have found that vendors are now more likely to  provide quality service in order to continue a partnership since  they are no longer having the power of owing the Integrated  
Library System software and tying down libraries to strict  contracts. This has been the case with the SC LENDS  consortium. Following the success of Evergreen for the  Georgia PINES library consortium, the South Carolina States  Library along with some local public libraries formed the SC LENDS consortium in order to share resources and to take  advantage of the open source nature of the Evergreen  Integrated Library System to meet their specific needs. 
By October 2011, just two years after SC LENDS began  operations, thirteen public library systems across 15 counties  had already joined the consortium in addition to the south  Caroline State Library. Librarytechnology.org does an annual  survey of over 1,500 libraries and noted in 2008, 2 % of those  who surveyed use the Integrated Library System, in 2009 the  number increased to 8%and in 2010(most recent year  available) 12% of the libraries polled had adopted open source  Library Management System.  
Library project system that offers many flexible and convenient  features, allowing librarians and library users to maximize time  and efficiency. Library system gives all the detailed  information about students, staffs and books, it will track the  books available in the library and the books that have been  issued to the library users (students). It shows popular books  among the students. It will provide book lost in the library. It  keeps records of the supplier and the book binders.
# FEATURES OF LMS 
i.Manage Book and Member Record with help of Barcode. 
ii.Acquisitions: With library Management software,  
Acquisitions function as generate Purchase order, Cancel Purchase Order ,  Reminder Purchase order ,Receive Purchase Order , Invoice and instantly available in Reports . Data can be search by feeding Purchase Order number,  Invoice number, and Supplier name.
